# File-Compression INTRODUCTION

File compression is a crucial technique employed in computer science and information technology to reduce the size of files, optimizing storage space and facilitating faster data transfer. This process involves encoding data using various algorithms to represent it more efficiently. Compressed files not only conserve storage but also contribute to quicker file transmission over networks. Common compression formats include ZIP and Huffman, each employing distinct algorithms to achieve compression. The balance between file size reduction and the computational cost of compression is a central consideration in the development and selection of compression techniques.

If the project contains an `Interface.java` file, it suggests that there might be an interface defined for the project, possibly indicating a graphical user interface (GUI) or some form of user interaction.

Here are steps you can follow:

 Step 1: Clone the Repository
Follow the initial steps mentioned in the previous response to clone the repository to your local machine.

Git clone MisbahHassan123/File-Compression


 Step 2: Navigate to Project Directory
Navigate to the project directory using the terminal or command prompt.


cd <project_directory>


Step 3: Compile the Java Code
If the project is written in Java, you might need to compile the Java code. Use the following command to compile the code:


javac Interface.java

Step 4: Run the Java Program
After successful compilation, run the Java program using the following command:


java Interface


 Step 5: Explore the Interface
If the `Interface.java` file is meant for a graphical user interface, a window or some form of UI should open. Explore the options and functionalities provided by the interface.

Step 6: Check for Dependencies
If the project has external dependencies, make sure they are installed. Look for any `lib` or `libs` folder that might contain necessary JAR files.
